#In programming you often need to know if an expression is True or False.

#You can evaluate any expression in Python, and get one of two answers, True or False.

#When you compare two values, the expression is evaluated and Python returns the Boolean answer:

print(10 > 9)
print(10 == 9)
print(10 < 9)

#print message

b = 33

if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
